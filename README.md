## ICA - Independent Component Analysis

ICA is an aproach to seperate a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents (source signals). This is done by assuming that the sources are non-Gaussian signals and that they are statistically independent from each other.
Given that a sum of independent signals goes to go gaussian distribution (by the Central Limit Theorem), maximizing the non-gaussianity will seperate the source signals that from the multivariate signal.
